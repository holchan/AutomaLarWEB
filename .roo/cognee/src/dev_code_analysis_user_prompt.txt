{{relevant_files_summary}}

Out-of-Scope Files Found (Top 3 - Metadata Only):
{{out_of_scope_summary}}
(Note: {{out_of_scope_count}} total out-of-scope files were found in other datasets.)

Available Relationship Types for Exploration: {{available_edge_types}}

# Task:

Based *only* on the query and the initial search results summarized above, create a detailed retrieval plan. Specify exactly:
1. Which files (by `file_path` and `vector_id`) need their *full content* retrieved, and the reason why.
2. What *additional search queries* (as text) should be run, and the reason why.
3. What specific *graph relationships* (by `vector_id`, `relationship_type`, `direction`) should be explored, and the reason why.

Explain the reasoning behind each planned step. Use the required JSON format precisely.
