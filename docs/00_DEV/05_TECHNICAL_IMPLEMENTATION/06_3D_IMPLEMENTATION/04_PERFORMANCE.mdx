# 3D Performance Optimizations

This document outlines strategies and considerations for optimizing the performance of 3D elements within the AutomaLar website, particularly focusing on techniques like Interior Depth Mapping.

## General Principles

*   **Minimize Draw Calls:** Combine geometries where possible.
*   **Optimize Textures:** Use appropriate formats (e.g., KTX2/Basis) and resolutions. Employ mipmapping.
*   **Level of Detail (LOD):** Implement LODs for complex models if necessary.
*   **Instancing:** Use instanced rendering for repeated geometries.
*   **Shader Optimization:** Keep shaders efficient. Avoid unnecessary calculations. Profile shader performance.

## Interior Depth Mapping Performance

The [Concept: Interior Depth Mapping](../../../concepts/00_INTERIOR_DEPTH_MAPPING.mdx) technique offers significant performance benefits over rendering full 3D interiors, but still requires careful optimization:

*   **Ray Marching Steps (`steps`):** This is a primary performance control. Lower values are faster but reduce quality/accuracy. Find the lowest acceptable value (e.g., 32, 64, 128).
*   **Texture Resolution:** While high-resolution textures (color, depth) improve visual quality, they increase memory usage and bandwidth requirements. Balance quality with performance targets. Consider using lower resolutions for less critical views or distances.
*   **Texture Formats:** Ensure depth maps are loaded as linear data. Use efficient formats for color maps (HDR formats like EXR can be large).
*   **Shader Complexity:** The ray marching loop is the most intensive part. Avoid complex calculations inside the loop.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Only run the Interior Depth Mapping shader when the element is visible or relevant.

## Performance Monitoring

*   Utilize browser developer tools (Performance tab).
*   Integrate `stats.js` or `@react-three/drei/Stats` for real-time FPS monitoring during development.
*   Profile GPU usage to identify bottlenecks.

*(Add specific measurements, benchmarks, and further optimization details as development progresses)*
