# Landing Page

## Hero Section

The hero section of the landing page will showcase the AUTOMALAR product using a visually stunning 3D interior effect. This effect is achieved using the Interior Depth Mapping ('3D Printing') technique, which combines environment maps and orthographically captured depth/color information to create the illusion of depth without rendering full 3D geometry.

For more details on the implementation of this technique, please refer to [Interior Depth Mapping Technique](/docs/05_TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION/06_3D_IMPLEMENTATION/05_INTERIOR_DEPTH_MAPPING.mdx).
