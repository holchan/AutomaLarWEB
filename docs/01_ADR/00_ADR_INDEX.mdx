# Architectural Decision Record (ADR) Index

This document lists all Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for this project. ADRs document architecturally significant decisions, interactions, research, and the evolution of ideas related to the project's development, providing context, rationale, and consequences.

**ADRs are listed in reverse chronological order (newest decision/record first, highest number at the top).** This order helps in quickly identifying the latest ADR number for new entries.

## Standard Architectural Decision Record (ADR) Template
- For creating new Architectural Decision Record (ADR) pages, use the:
- **Template:** [ADR Template](./01_ADR_TEMPLATE)

---
*(When a new ADR is created, add its entry to the TOP of the list below. Ensure the ADR number is sequential and correctly formatted. The link MUST be relative and omit the .md or .mdx file extension as per project linking guidelines.)*

- [ADR-001: Example Initial ADR Title](./ADR-001-example-initial-adr-title)
