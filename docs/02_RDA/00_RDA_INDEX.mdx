# Research Data Artifact (RDA) Index

This document lists all Research Data Artifacts (RDAs) for this project. RDAs serve as records for research activities, data collection, analysis, findings, and supporting evidence related to various aspects of the project's development and investigation.

**RDAs are listed in reverse chronological order (newest artifact first, highest number at the top).** This order helps in quickly identifying the latest RDA number for new entries.

## Standard Research Data Artifact (RDA) Template
- For creating new Research Data Artifact pages, use the:
- **Template:** [RDA Template](./01_RDA_TEMPLATE)

---
*(When a new RDA is created, add its entry to the TOP of the list below. Ensure the RDA number is sequential and correctly formatted (e.g., RDA-NNN). The link MUST be relative and omit the .md or .mdx file extension as per project linking guidelines.)*

- [RDA-001: Example Initial Research Topic](./RDA-001-example-initial-research-topic)
