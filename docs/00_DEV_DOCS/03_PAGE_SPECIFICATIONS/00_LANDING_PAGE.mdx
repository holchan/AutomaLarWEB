# Landing Page

## Hero Section

The hero section of the landing page will showcase the AUTOMALAR product using a visually stunning 3D interior effect. This effect is achieved using the **Interior Depth Mapping** ('3D Printing') technique. See the main [Concept: Interior Depth Mapping](../../concepts/00_INTERIOR_DEPTH_MAPPING.mdx) definition for a high-level overview. This technique combines environment maps and orthographically captured depth/color information to create the illusion of depth without rendering full 3D geometry.

For more details on the specific implementation, please refer to the [Interior Depth Mapping Technical Details](../../05_TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION/06_3D_IMPLEMENTATION/05_INTERIOR_DEPTH_MAPPING.mdx).
