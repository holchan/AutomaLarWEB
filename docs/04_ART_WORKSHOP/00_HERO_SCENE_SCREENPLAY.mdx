# Hero Scene Asset Requirements

## Living Room Scene - Asset Requirements

To support the **Interior Depth Mapping** ('3D Printing') technique (see main [Concept: Interior Depth Mapping](../../concepts/00_INTERIOR_DEPTH_MAPPING.mdx) definition) for the hero section's living room scene, the following assets are required from the 3D artist:

1. **Environment Cubemap (for Room Structure):**
   * **Format:** Standard 6x1 layout image.
   * **Resolution:** 1024px per face (6144x1024 total) or higher.
   * **Type:** Color image (e.g., `.png`).
   * **Content:** Renders of the empty room walls, floor, ceiling.

2. **Interior Object Maps (for Objects 3D rendering):**
   * **Format:** Orthographic-90ยบ FOV.
   * **Resolution:** 1024x1024 or 2048x2048.
   * **Type:** Color image (e.g., `.png`) orthographic render from one of the bounding view of one of the sides of the cube towards the center, containing color and lighting information of the interior objects *only* (room structure should be masked out).
   * **Front Color Map:** Orthographic render from the center of the room looking forward (+Z direction).
   * **Back Color Map:** Orthographic render from the center of the room looking backward (-Z direction).
   * **Left Color Map:** Orthographic render from the center of the room looking left (-X direction).
   * **Right Color Map:** Orthographic render from the center of the room looking right (+X direction).
   * **Top Color Map:** Orthographic render from the center of the room looking up (+Y direction).
   * **Bottom Color Map:** Orthographic render from the center of the room looking down (-Y direction).

3. **Depth Maps (Orthographic-90ยบ FOV):**
   * **Resolution:** Same as color maps (1024x1024 or 2048x2048).
   * **Format:** 16-bit grayscale PNG or EXR.
   * **Content:** Z-depth information normalized to 0-1 range, where 0 (black) represents surfaces closest to the camera and 1 (white) represents the farthest surfaces.
   * **Front Depth Map:** Depth information from the center looking forward.
   * **Back Depth Map:** Depth information from the center looking backward.
   * **Left Depth Map:** Depth information from the center looking left.
   * **Right Depth Map:** Depth information from the center looking right.
   * **Top Depth Map:** Depth information from the center looking up.
   * **Bottom Depth Map:** Depth information from the center looking down.

4. **Camera Position Reference:**
   * A reference file indicating the exact position in the 3D scene where the camera should be placed (center of the room).
   * This ensures that the web implementation matches the rendered perspective.

5. **Lighting Information:**
   * **Format:** Text document or scene file.
   * **Content:** Description of key light sources, colors, and intensities to ensure the 3D logo is lit consistently with the environment.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Rendering Settings:**
   * **Color Space:** Linear sRGB (not gamma-corrected in the source files).
   * **Bit Depth:** 16-bit per channel minimum for HDR content.
   * **Tone Mapping:** None (raw linear values).

2. **Depth Map Generation:**
   * Depth maps should be rendered with a Z-depth pass.
   * Values should be normalized to the 0-1 range.
   * No post-processing filters should be applied to the depth maps.

3. **File Naming Convention:**
   * `livingroom_[direction]_color.exr` (e.g., `livingroom_front_color.exr`)
   * `livingroom_[direction]_depth.png` (e.g., `livingroom_front_depth.png`)
   * Where `[direction]` is one of: `front`, `back`, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`

## Delivery Format

All assets should be delivered in a structured folder hierarchy:
